Continuous integration is crucial when working within a [[Bounded Context]] to notice when [[Splinters within a Bounded Context||splinters]] appear and to correct them quickly. [[Conceptual integration]] is also useful to utilise within a [[Bounded Context]].

It is practically a good idea to separate your Continuous integration pipelines so that you have a pipeline per [[Bounded Context]] rather than a single pipeline for multiple [[Bounded Context]].
