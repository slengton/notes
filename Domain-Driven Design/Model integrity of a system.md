[[Unification]] of the domain [[model]] for a large system is not feasible or cost-effective:
1. By trying to satisfy all use-cases within a single [[model]] we will likely end up with a [[model]] that is difficult to use and overly complex
2. Coordination across an organisation because quite difficult and expensive when we have multiple teams working with a single [[model]]

As an alternative we can designate parts of our system to be [[Unification|unified]], and leave the other parts [[Unification|un-unified]] as we know these parts will not cause confusion or corruption.

For the [[Unification|unified]] parts of our system we define the [[Bounded Context|contexts]] and the [[Model|models]] that are applicable within those [[Bounded Context|contexts]].
