# Frameworks for learning new skills
## F.A.S.T

^867ce6

### F - Forget
1. Forget what you think you know about the skill. Quite likely we need to unlearn bad habits we already have
2. Forget about situational things. When learning a skill be present in the moment. Learn to take quick notes if something is distracting you and continue to focus on learning the skill
3. Forget about your self-imposed limitations (aka learnt helplessness). All behaviour is belief driven: "Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right."

### A - Active
1. Do not be passive when learning a new skill
2. Be consistent with learning the new skill
3. Learning a skill requires a [[Creating habits|habit]] to be formed, so having a trigger is important. Schedule time in your calendar or find a different trigger

### S - State
1. All learning is state dependent. The state of your body and mind greatly affect how effective your learning will be
2. If your happy, energised and focussed you are far more likely to remember what you learn than when you're not
3. Long-term memory = information * emotion
4. We want to utilise the confidence-competence loop:
	1. The more confident you get at doing someting
	2. The more competent you get at doing it and then
	3. You get even more confident in doing it, thus starting the loop again

### T - Teach
1. Learn with the intent to teach
2. When you learn with the intent to teach you would pay more attention and enjoy learning more
