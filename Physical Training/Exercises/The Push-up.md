# The Push-up
## Execution
1. Starting point:
	- Start in a plank position
	- Your hands should be directly under your shoulders
	- Spread your fingers and rotate your hands so that the "V" formed by your thumb and index fingers are pointing forward (helps align arms and shoulders properly and prevents elbows from flaring out as you lower your body)
	- Tighten your abs, squeeze your butt, and flatten your back so your body is neutral and straight
1. Lower your body until your chest touches the floor:
	- Keep tight and ensure that your back stays flat
	- Don't let your but sag or stick up; keep your body in a straight line
	- Focus your eyes on a spot about 60cm ahead of you to ensure that you maintain a neutral neck
	- Elbows should be kept close and parallel to your body, don't flare them out
1. Push back up to the starting position
	- Keep everythin tight and engaged, maintaining a straight line
