# Kettlebell Swing
## Execution
1. Start with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width and point your toes out a bit. Throughout the movement your weight should be in the middle of your foot and your knees should track in line with your toes.
1. Set the kettlebell about 30cm in front of your toes
1. Comfortably grip the kettlebell so that it is only slightly loose in your hand(s). 
1. To start the swing, hike the kettlebell between your legs so that the kettleball is extended behind you and your forearms meet your inner thigh.
1. Using your hips, drive the kettlebell through your legs and up until it is extended horizontally out in front of you.
1. Then as the kettlebell falls, control it back through your legs to the starting position.

## Some tips
- The swing is a hinge movement, not a squat. You should be lowering your butt instead of bending your knees and keeping your shins vertical to the floor.
- Keep your back straight throughout the movement and keep bracing your core. Your mid-section should be in a straight line throughout the movement.
- Move the kettlebell with your hips, not your arms. Your arms should not be raising the kettlebell, but simply holding it.
- Keep your shoulders in a relaxed but stable position.
- Once you finish a set, allow the kettlebell to come to rest before setting it down.
