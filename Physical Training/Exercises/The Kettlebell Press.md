# The Kettlebell Press
## Execution
1. Clean the kettlebell to the starting position
	1. Extend your legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell up from the ground and towards your shoulder
	2. As you raise the kettlebell rotate your wrist so that your arms faces inward
	3. Your wrist should be strong and straight (not bent)
	4. Let the kettlebell rest in the crook of your elbow at around chest height
2. Stabilise your body by squeezing your butt and engaging your core
3. Look at the kettlebell as you press it up overhead. Keep your wrist locked in a straight line
4. Slowly lower the kettlebell down under control and repeat

## Some tips
- Don't let the kettlebell drift too far away from your body. Imagine you are inside a chimney
- Breathing:
	-   Exhale as you compress the rib cage (at the bottom)
	-   Exhale as you press up
	-   Exhale at the top again
	-   Exhale when the kettlebell drops to the rack position
* At the top the arm should be fully extended and the thumb should be pointing to the back
* Initiate the movement from your lats, not your shoulders
