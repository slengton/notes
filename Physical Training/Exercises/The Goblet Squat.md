# The Goblet Squat
## Execution
1. Start by holding a relatively light kettlebell at your chest with both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart (jump up and down 3 times to verify the perfect width)
1. Brace your core and begin the movement by moving your butt back and down (pretend your going to be sitting down). Lower yourself down as far as you can go, while keeping your chest up and your back straight. Aim to go lower every time so that at the end you'll be able to perform a full deep squat.
1. From the bottom of the squat drive from your heels and rise back to standing. Ensure that your knees, back and butt are all moving at the same speed so that you maintain an upright posture throughout the movement.
