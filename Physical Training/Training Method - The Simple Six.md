# Training Method: The Simple Six

## The Why of this program
- This program aims to provide a simple way to build a balanced, strong and capable physique whilst keeping time in the gym to a minimum
- Since consistency is key to health and fitness, this program aims to make it easy to consistently train
- Apply the parito principle to your training (if you make it 80% of the time the other 20% will likely be negligible)
- This program makes use of the rolling focus (RF) technique where each day we switch to focus on one of the exercises (i.e. do more sets of said exercise)

## Exercises

## Progression
1. For all exercises except the kettlebell swing, adjust the time under tension from 1:1:1 temp to 5:1:5 before increasing the wait. For a pushup 1:1:1 tempo would be 1 second to lower the body, 1 second to pause at the bottom and 1 second to raise back up
1. For the kettlebell swing, slowly increase the number of reps until you're able to perform 20 reps before moving to a heavier weight

## FAQ
- How many reps for chin-ups?
	1. If able to do 10, then 10
	2. Can't do 1? Then start with negative chin-ups
	3. If can do some, but not 10 then:
		1. On normal days do max -1
		2. On RF days do (max-1)/2
* How much rest?
	* If focus on getting heart rate up and short sessions: 30-60 seconds max
	* If focus on strenght: 1-3 minutes max
	- Can even do superset in morning and RF in evening or use GTG protocol
* How should I go about including walking?
	* You can split it up, e.g. 15 minutes per session, but try to achieve at least 30 minutes of casual walking
	* You can combine modes, e.g. 15 minutes of uphill walking and 15 minutes of casual walking
