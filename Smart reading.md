# Keys to learning to read smarter
1. Ask more questions
2. Make reading a [[Creating habits|habit]]
3. Smart reading is not just about acquiring knowledge. Power comes from using knowledge, so knowledge is simply potential power
4. Employ the [[Learning a skill#^867ce6|F.A.S.T]] framework to learn smart reading

# Questions to consider whilst learning reading
1. What is your motivation for wanting to read with greater speed and comprehension?
2. What will you do with the extra tiem that this may afford you?
3. Who will you in turn teach to read smarter?

# What are the obstacles to effective reading?
1. Lack of education
	1. This could well be a skill that you haven't learnt properly yet. The last time most of us learnt how to read was at grade school
	2. Taught how to read slowly
2. Lack of focus
	1. We weren't taught how to focus whilst reading
	2. If we read too slowly our brain starts getting bored and looking for entertainment elsewhere in the form of distraction
3. Regression
	1. Skipping back to words you've already read
	2. We may well be unconsciously rereading words
	3. This breaks up the momentum and rhythm of reading. Imagine someone would do this with a move

# Steps for learning to read smarter
## Step 1: Get a baseline for your reading speed
To start of we will focus on first improving reading speed and later on comprehension. As such grab a light fiction type novel that is preferably something fun that you want to read. Ideally this should be a physical book.

In order to manage something, the first step is to measure it. As such we will do a simple exercise to get a baseline for your current reading speed:
1. Read for 2 minutes whilst marking the start and endpoint in your book
2. Count the number of lines that you've read
	1. Count lines that are more than half-way through the page or estimate an approximation (e.g. when having two half lines)
3. Average words per line can be calculated by using the average word cound of 3 lines
	1. In most books this is around 10 lines
4. Lines per minute = lines read / 2
5. Base words per minute rate = lines per minute * average words per line

## Step 2: Introduce a visual pacer
Try to read with a visual pacer for at least 10 minutes.
At this stage put comprehension aside and focus simply on following your finger.
There is no need to time yourself for now.

### Why introduce a visual pacer?
- Children inadvertently use a visual pacer
- When counting lines you probably used a visual pacer
- Our eyes are attracted to movement
- Our neorology is setup so that our sense of sight is closely linked to our sense of touch (similar to how our sense of taste is closely linked to our sense of smell)

### How to read with a pacer?
- Use a finger to go across the page from left to right
- Underline the words with your finger
- Follow the tip of your finger with your eyes
- Avoid touching the page
